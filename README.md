# keras2tensorflow

Our scientists use keras to train models (python), but we needs them on SmartPhone (use c++), so I develop this tools to prediction with tensorflow (c++).

## usage

on python, use test/testKeras2tensorflow.py to dump protobuf from keras's model.

on c++, use test/testKeras2tensorflow.cpp to load protobuf and prediction.
